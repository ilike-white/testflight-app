## Information
### Discord
To find the nice, formatted data and talk with others, [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/zJdYgrRdNm).

### Raw Data
To get the raw data, go to `testflights.xlsx`.

### Request Testflight Link
If you want to add a Testflight, either put it in the Discord (more info in `#guide`), or make an issue and label it `request`.

### Incorrect/Invalid Data
If there is any incorrect data about any Testflight links, either put it in the Discord (more info in `#guide`), or make an issue and label it `invalid`.

### Plan for This
Eventually, I will make my own Testflight for an app, which just has all the Testflights. It'll have an official/community browse page, all the Testflights you've installed (to not appear in the browse), and a few more features. I might also change the idea along the road and turn it into a web scraper overview app to see all the information from every web scraper you have (probably won't). I'm a solo-dev in high school, so this is just a passion project to learn about coding. I would only make a Patreon to sustain a web scraper, but for now it'll run on my devices.
